Little Bobby loves chocolate. He frequently goes to his favorite  store, Penny Auntie, to buy them. They are having a promotion at Penny Auntie. If Bobby saves enough wrappers, he can turn them in for a free chocolate.

Example
n = 15
c = 3
m = 2


He has 15 to spend, bars cost 3, and he can turn in 2 wrappers to receive another bar. Initially, he buys 5 bars and has 5 wrappers after eating them. He turns in 4 of them, leaving him with 1, 2 for  more bars. After eating those two, he has 3 wrappers, turns in 2 leaving him with 1 wrapper and his new bar. Once he eats that one, he has 2 wrappers and turns them in for another bar. After eating that one, he only has 1 wrapper, and his feast ends. Overall, he has eaten  5+2+1+1 = 9 bars.
